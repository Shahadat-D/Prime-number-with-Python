# Prime-number-with-Python
Find prime with python 

The algorithm uses an array to find prime insted of moduling the number by every number lower than it or lower than half of it.
So it isn't accurate 100% of the time. 

The algrothim can easily check upto a 1M but any more than that may cause false positive.

To use the algorithm import is_prime from is_prime.py and use it.
It will return True or False depending on the result.
